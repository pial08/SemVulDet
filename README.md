# An Unbiased Transformer Source Code Learning with Semantic Vulnerability Graph

This code provides the implementation of *RoBERTa-PFGCN* as described in out paper, a method to generate Graph of 
Program dubbed SVG with our novel Poacher Flow Edges. We use RoBERTa to generate embeddings and GCN for vulnerability detection and classification.

#### Requirements
- Python 	3.7
- Pytorch 	1.9 
- Transformer 	4.4
- torchmetrics 0.11.4
- tree-sitter 0.20.1
- sctokenizer 0.0.8

Moreover the above libraries can be installed by the commands from *requirements.txt* file. It is assumed that the installation will be done in a Linux system with a GPU. If GPU does not exist please remove the first command from the *requirements.txt*  file and replace it with 

`conda install pytorch==1.9.1 torchvision==0.10.1 torchaudio==0.9.1 -c pytorch` for OSX

or 


`conda install pytorch==1.9.0 torchvision==0.10.1 torchaudio==0.9.1 cpuonly -c pytorch` for Linux and Windows with no GPU.

Instructions to install libraries using *requirements.txt* file.

```shell
cd code 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Usage
The repository is partially based on [CodeXGLUE](https://github.com/microsoft/CodeXGLUE/tree/main/Code-Code/Defect-detection).


### Training and Evaluation
The following command should be used for training, testing and evaluation. Please set the ```--output_dir``` to the address where the model will be saved. We have also compiled a shell file with the same command for ease of use for the practitioners. Please put the location/address of train, evaluation and test file directory for the parameters
```--train_data_file```, ```--eval_data_file``` and ```--test_data_file```. 


Please run the following commands:

```shell
cd code

./run.sh

or,

python run.py --output_dir=<output_directory> --model_type=roberta --tokenizer_name=microsoft/graphcodebert-base --model_name_or_path=microsoft/graphcodebert-base \
	--do_eval --do_test --do_train --train_data_file=<training_data_directory> --eval_data_file=<eval_data_directory> --test_data_file=<test_data_directory> \
	--block_size 400 --train_batch_size 512 --eval_batch_size 512 --max_grad_norm 1.0 --evaluate_during_training \
	--gnn ReGCN --learning_rate 5e-4 --epoch 100 --hidden_size 512 --num_classes 2 --model_checkpoint <saved_directory> --num_GNN_layers 2 --format uni --window_size 5 \
	--seed 123456 2>&1 | tee $logp/training_log.txt

```

### Shell file parameters explaination
Here we explain some of the important parameters we used for our application. 

| Parameters | Default Values | Values | Description |
| :---:    | :---:   |:---:                | :---: |
| `--loss` | `focal` | *focal* or *weight* | Change parameters based on the usage of focal loss or weighted loss |
| `--graph`| `SVG`   | *SVG* or *AST* | Change parameters based on the graph generation method |
| `--alpha`| `0.1`   | 0-1 | The number should be a floating point |
| `--gamma`| `2.0`   | 0-INF | Floating value ranging from 0 to infinity. If the value is 0, effect os gamma is ignored |


### Datasets
- Please download our [VulF](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d00kfEX6k1MhpxJtuFv5JqtlQTJfg03N?usp=sharing) dataset VulF directory.

- Our N-day and zero-day samples are also available in the previous link under *Testing* directory.
- After downloading VulF dataset, please put it under the directory *data*.

### Reproducibility
In order to use our pre-trained model, please download our model from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d00kfEX6k1MhpxJtuFv5JqtlQTJfg03N?usp=sharing) under the Saved Model directory. After downloading, please set the value of the parameter `--model_checkpoint` to local directory you saved the pre-trained model.
